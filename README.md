## 🌐 Coding Community Best Practices

You are expected to follow coding best practices throughout the project. This includes:

- **Git Flow**:
  - Work on a feature branch (`feature/your-task-name`)
  - Use pull requests to merge into `develop`
  - Only merge to `main` once the feature is tested and approved
- **Meaningful Commits**:
  - Example: `feat: add employee form component` or `fix: resolve API auth header issue`
- **Clean Code Principles**:
  - Avoid duplication
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused
- **Code Reviews**:
  - If collaborating, open PRs and assign for review
